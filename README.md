This project examines how much—and what type of—coverage Peru received in The New York Times during 2025. The findings can help government, academia, and the private sector better understand Peru’s international image. In future work, the same approach could be extended to additional global media outlets.

I then classify the articles with ChatGPT and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate summary statistics and visual insights. Finally, I document the full workflow—how the data are retrieved via the NYT API and how the dataset is processed and analyzed.
